## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this project easily on Replit or on your local machine.

### Running on Replit (Easiest Method)
This project is pre-configured for Replit.
1.  Open the Repl.
2.  Click the big green **"Run"** button.
3.  The backend will compile and start, and the frontend will automatically appear in the WebView pane.

### Running Locally
**Prerequisites:**
* Rust and Cargo installed (see [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/))
* A modern web browser

**Instructions:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd fraud-detection-service
    ```
2.  Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend
    # Compile and run the project in release mode
    cargo run --release
    ```
3.  The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your web browser to view and interact with the dashboard.
